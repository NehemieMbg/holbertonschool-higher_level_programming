<h1>Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples</h1>
<p>In Python, list and tuple are a class of data structures that can store one or more objects or values. A list is used to store multiple items in one variable and can be created using square brackets. Similarly, tuples also can store multiple items in a single variable and can be declared using parentheses.</p>
